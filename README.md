👋 Hi there, I am Neh

I am a soon-to-be **Computer Science graduate** from the **University of Guelph** who is passionate about building practical, impact-driven software. 

I enjoy turning abstract ideas I have into projects that help simplify tasks and deliver value. Most of my work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, data science, and machine learning**, where I enjoy working on projects from the concept phase all the way to the implementation phase.
